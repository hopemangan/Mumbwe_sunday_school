     <h2>How We Got Started:</h2>
     <p>
         Mumbwe Sunday School Place began with three friends, who all happened to be volunteer Sunday school teachers. Discussion of creating this site began in the summer of 1999. For more information on how we got started and how we grew into a leading web-based Sunday school resource, see: <a href="#">Site History</a>.

     <h2>Our Backgrounds:</h2>
     <p>
         We have a wide variety of educational backgrounds and teaching experience. Some of us served as children's pastors or teachers. Others worked on mission fields around the world. Members of our staff also attended workshops, classes, and seminars relating to children's ministry. Combined, we have several decades of Sunday school teaching experience.
